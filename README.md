*Emphasize* _ First task and repository at ALX software engineering programme.  _
 Hello everyone! this is my first task and repository at ALX software engineering programme.
Even Though I really do not know much about markdown at the moment, I have decided to become a pro in markdown through:
* Constant and dedicated research on markdown
* Long practice with markdown syntax/element
* watching video tutorial on markdown.
I think markdown is cool because it's"
1. Human readable
2. Has no opening and closing syntax
3. Has plain text.
